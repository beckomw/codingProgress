### Wayne Allen Beckom

Dynamic and results-driven, I bring over 8 years of diverse experience in customer service, sales and recruitment with a strong focus on finance and tech. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems with a Software Development emphasis. I'm attending Arapahoe Community College's 4 year plan via Colorado State University.

My extensive background in recruiting has honed my interpersonal and project managmement skills making me an amazing communicator, collaborator and problem solver. I'm now looking to transition into a back-end development career. This is mainly where I store my code for my school projects disregard the name of the folder because I like to use many languages and test many things on this page.

[^1]:My portfolio is pretty simple, I focus on the back-end to ensure things are working effectively and easy to implement saving time and money. I know basic front-end technologies but I prefer to work on the back-end using Java or Python.
